## UDM Monitor 6.0

This release is a big UI refactor aimed at making the app easier to use *and* easier to maintain.

**Highlights**

- Split the giant main table into three focused views:
  - **Alerts** (top): recent high-volume alerts and threshold events.
  - **Active Connections** (middle): live flows on your LAN.
  - **Per-Device Totals** (bottom): per-MAC aggregates and destinations.
- Added **status icons** (small coloured squares) in all three tables:
  - Green = labelled host (custom name)
  - Blue  = known vendor
  - Red   = unknown/randomised vendor
- New **legend** at the top explaining both row highlights and status colours.
- Column widths are now **remembered** between runs and can be tuned via the UI.

**Under the hood**

- The three tables are now built and refreshed by helper functions in `ui_tables.py`.
- Column widths and table sorting have been de-tangled and are easier to adjust.
- Various minor bugs fixed (geometry manager conflicts, sorting issues, linter noise).

If you’re upgrading, simply drop in the new `main.py`, `ui_tables.py`, `ui_theme.py`,
`monitor_core.py`, `collectors.py`, and `vendor_resolver.py`, keeping your existing
`config.json`/`data` directory.
